     <p3>Sprinting is running over a short distance at the top-most speed of the body in a limited period of time. It is used in many sports that incorporate running, typically as a way of quickly reaching a target or goal, or avoiding or catching an opponent. Human physiology dictates that a runner's near-top speed cannot be maintained for more than 30â€“35 seconds due to the depletion of phosphocreatine stores in muscles, and perhaps secondarily to excessive metabolic acidosis as a result of anaerobic glycolysis.[1]</p>

     <h2><center>LONG JUMP</center></h2>
     <p><center>Minimum 06 mtr<center></p>
     <p2>long jump is an event used in the athletic category. The test consists of covering as much distance as possible in a horizontal plane after a race. It is one of the most spontaneous  sporting gestures that exist today. So we can say that the jump consists of making a single leap forward, taking off with one leg after the impulse generated by the race. It was part of the first Olympic Games in ancient Greece and was also one of the most modern games that were enjoyed for the first time in 1896.</p>
